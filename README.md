# Homework-Automation-Hack

This Python script file analyzes all the assignments that need to be turned in over a particular time frame. The script file then converts the dataframe into a .csv file and emails it to myself. If you are running the exact same code, make sure the email that you are logging in to has access to allowing sending email from less secure apps. (You can do this in allow access under privacy setting under settings in your Gmail).

All of this happens within 2-3 seconds, saving him over 4 minutes of his life (not a lot, but helpful when integrated over a longer period of time).
